# xamarinshell

To demonstrate custom renderers for Xamarin.Shell. 
This example is actually targeting to customize bottom navigation tabs. 
Grafics are powered by SkiaSharp.

BottomTabs:

- using SVG icons
- icons can use optional linear gradient, with optional direction
- can add and customize notification badges
- icons labels can be switch on/off
- can change font and size of labels

Added options support Xaml HotReload. 

CustomizeShellToolbar renderer in present for purposes on how to customize it but not used in this example.

Guess the description remains in ToDo state, meanwhile grab and use if needed and see you in MAUI :)
